# Sanity AI Helper

I can help you build with Sanity. Here are the skills I have available:

**🚀 Setup & Config**
- `setup visual editing` - Configure Stega, Overlays, and Loaders for your framework.
- `install rules` - Install Sanity best practices locally for Cursor, Claude Code, or VS Code.
- `setup typegen` - Configure and troubleshoot TypeScript generation.

**📝 Content Modelling**
- `scaffold schema` - Create new Document, Object, or Singleton types.
- `deprecate field` - Safely deprecate a field without data loss.
- `migrate schema` - Generate migration scripts.

**🔎 Querying**
- `write query` - Help write optimized GROQ queries.

**🛠️ Content Operations**
- I can also access the **Sanity MCP Server** directly to query data, create documents, and manage datasets.

**How to start?**
Just ask me naturally! For example:
> "Help me create a blog post schema"
> "Why is my visual editing not working?"
> "Run a query to find the latest 5 posts"
